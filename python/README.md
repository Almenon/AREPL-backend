This folder contains the python sourcecode and tests for arepl.
It also has various python libraries (hardcoded so the user of arepl doesnt need to install anything)

## Note on file naming convention
Files start with arepl to avoid conflicting with user files.
If they were named with something generic like "saved.py" then a user might have a file with the same name and that would conflict.
